Diem constantly interrupts conversations when we're actually getting information, and is consistently aggravating and stubborn when it's about the worst decision she could make. She even acknowledges her rash decisions, but continues making them anyways?? Diem also chooses random people as her advisors, which is completely baffling. She also says that ""all the Descended are monsters"" when she is clearly friends with multiple of the Descended AND enjoys their presences??

(Low bar, I know.) However, the more that I think about this book, the more I'm disappointed with it, which is unfortunate. I think this could've been an extra 100-200 pages and it would've been far better with the pacing. This had a good amount of wasted potential.<br/><br/>One of the few things that were pissing me off was Diem’s attitude: there were so many times she should’ve just kept her mouth shut and head down. In any other book with actual consequences for insulting the (powerful) upper class repeatedly, she would’ve been in chains. Absolutely shocked how many times she mouthed off to literally everyone and was REWARDED for it. Or when she wasn’t rewarded, all the consequences for doing so are EXACTLY her fault! Can she just be not stupid for one second? Made no sense and made me so angry at how much of an idiot she is.<br/><br/>The other thing is (though I’m not surprised) is how… this basically isn’t enemies to lovers. People keep advertising their books as enemies to lovers when they’re really not. It’s basically just miscommunication and him being a little bit of a dick, sometimes, but not really. When are we going to get enemies to lovers that has actual ENEMIES? Moreover, there really wasn’t much of a slow burn. While I thought it was going to be slow initially, it started ramping up the pace pretty quickly and it was obvious the MMC felt something towards Diem (she was already attracted to him physically, which she couldn’t stop repeating in her thoughts), so… yeah. Not really that slow. <br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it... there's literally no substance with the supposed romance between Luther and Diem. He, for some reason, enjoys her presence or likes her, but it's never explained why. They kiss, but they've genuinely interacted maybe about one hour in this entire book? Like, why is he the romantic interest when we know nothing about him and they don't have any kind of relationship? It's absolutely nonsensical and I'm hoping for some explanations in the next book.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, so much of this book feels like a nothing burger. The romance is barely there, we know she's obviously not getting with Henri, and she <spoiler>joins the rebels then immediately leaves them</spoiler>. The only thoroughly written part of this book is Diem's character arc. It doesn't help that she's constantly stupid. This book feels more like a build up than an actual plot... which is unfortunate. I really think this book had a lot of wasted potential and it could've been really good.<br/><br/>I still had a good amount of fun reading this. I wanted to see what would happen with Diem's <spoiler>powers</spoiler>, and I basically just wanted to see what would happen next. I kind of finished the book a little bit confused based on the lack of development with the romance. And as I said, pretty predictable. The romance is obvious, the group of rebels is repetitive, her not being a mortal is obvious, the ending became obvious… so if you’re looking for something surprising and mysterious, this is probably not your best bet. But for some reason, I still had fun. Overall, I’d give this 3.25 stars.",,,1,0

This was basically ACOTAR but worse, and I'd rather read ACOTAR because I actually enjoyed ACOTAR. And at least ACOTAR had a plot!<br/><br/>We spend this book mostly focused on two POVs: Lor, and her grandmother from about 300 years ago, explaining </spoiler>how the Heart Kingdom shat itself,</spoiler> basically. 9/10ths of Lor's plot is entirely about her relationship with Nadir; the last 1/10th is about finding the Heart Crown, but it's honestly so flimsy and boring (and obvious that it's just being used to further the romantic development) that I literally didn't care about it. Which is unfortunate, because the romantic relationship was also so boring that I didn't care about that, either. Which left me with the other POV; which was initially boring, and then gradually got more interesting. Sadly that POV was only like 1/4 of the entire book. Did I mention this book was boring?<br/><br/>As for the specifics of the romance... I don't think I liked a single thing. This was barely enemies-to-lovers, since she was never his enemy, and she hated him for reasons that didn't really feel like they justified true hatred. He kidnapped her... but he also rescued her from Atlas? He's not torturing her, AND <spoiler>his friends brought her siblings back.</spoiler> And he's just being kind of dickish, not genuinely hurting her. Like, at the 30% mark there's literally no reason for us to call this enemies-to-lovers. Moreover, essentially the entire time they're basically eye-fucking each other (she even has a sex dream about him!), which eventually progresses to full out fucking by the 50% mark or so. Slow burn? Who's she? <br/><br/>He's also like a complete asshole to her in one scene where she flirts with a guy to get information; he gets EXTREMELY and nonsensically possessive and basically ruins their plan... and then he says she's basically ""spreading her legs"" for everyone or whatever. (What happens is he says she should go spread her legs for the other guy, and then asks if she did the same for Atlas.) He also calls her ""Inmate"" which is... just weird. And bad. And calling her a nickname that's related to her ten-year traumatizing stint as a prisoner, which she keeps referencing as something that was extremely traumatizing? I was absolutely not a fan and kind of icked out. These are not the traits of a love interest I like. <br/><br/>Speaking of weird/bad Nadir moments, here's some dialogue that sounded so strange: <i>""I am your worst nightmare, Inmate. But right now, I’m going to make you come so hard, you’re not going to care.""</i> It's the Inmate. ""I'm your worst nightmare""? If he actually were, it might be more interesting, but he's so obviously not that it just makes me grimace. (He also steals her underwear and doesn't give it back, making her walk around without it in public... it's only portrayed as fine because she's fine with it, even though she doesn't say so... but like, what the hell, bro? They're not even in a relationship yet to communicate this shit?!)<br/><br/>The two-dimensional-ness of every character has basically continued from the first book; while he does have some traits beyond ""she's so hot/I'm obsessed with her"" and ""I'm a mopey prince"" it's... not much. He's not very interesting and I don't care about him, so I didn't really care about the romance.<br/><br/>(As an aside, any conflict within the relationship kept being generated by stupid things he did? Hello? I don't like him.)<br/><br/>Lor, on the other hand... I guess I'm glad she's not stupid and naive? There were a few moments where I was like ""goddamnit"" but it wasn't her entire personality, which was nice. There was a moment where she went out to get <spoiler>her siblings from the prison while running through the freezing cold forest with no winter clothes... probably miles from the prison.</spoiler> It was extremely stupid, but that felt like pretty much the only colossally stupid thing she did. (I think my bar has become way too low for this genre.) So she was alright, but since her entire POV consisted of sleeping with and obsessing over Nadir... I didn't really care.<br/><br/>There was one part with Lor that really pissed me off, however, and it makes book one worse in retrospect. In this book, she says: <i>“For months, for years, he brought me into the Keep regularly—to the catacombs, as you called them. There, he tried everything he could to get my magic out of me. He tortured me and tormented me with his power.”</i> Um... doesn't this seem like an important thing to reveal in the first book? That she's been fucking tortured by the king himself? But noooo, we have to pretend that she had no idea what was going on the in the first book; she was just a Normal Human Girl! God, fuck me, I really can't deal with this series.<br/><br/>But there was that one bright spot in this entire book (and it's the entire reason I'm not giving this book a pure one star). The fact that we see the ancestor's POV (Serce) and we see her point of view and <spoiler>she's clearly doing bad things</spoiler> and we still sympathize with her is FUN! I <i>like</i> seeing her <spoiler>destroy everything around her</spoiler> because at least it's interesting. The ending was actually something I didn't expect and that made me not hate the entire book. I did want to see what was going to happen next in the series, but I managed to find spoilers in other reviews and now I don't care. This book was not worth it and I only finished it to give it a bad review. 1.5 stars rounded down.",,,1,0

And that's what matters to me.<br/><br/>This is pretty much a <spoiler>copy-paste of the romantic plot</spoiler> in ACOTAR. But I LOOVE a good <spoiler>bait and switch</spoiler> romance, so I was really happy with that. Of course, the world building and the personalities of every character except the MC were pretty flimsy, but not so flimsy that I didn't enjoy reading this book. It was kind of obvious what was going to happen and what exactly the plot twists were going to be, but I wanted them to happen so I was still satisfied. The relationship with the MC and the main love interest feels so bland and shallow <spoiler>that it's kind of obvious that he's going to be a dick</spoiler>. But I still liked that we could see a realistic progression of the <spoiler>reveal of his personality</spoiler>.<br/><br/>As for the MC, these types of books usually have idiotic, naive, and childish girls for their main characters (which I very much hate), so I was surprised to see that that wasn't FULLY true in this one (more in the next paragraph). Sure, she's brash and impulsive, but she didn't appear to constantly make idiotic decisions since her reactions seemed realistic for her situation. Her previous life in a prison creates personality traits that usually make sense. (At least she doesn't act like she's 15.)<br/><br/>There was one pretty big issue I did have, though. One thing that never works for me is when the main character knows information the audience doesn't know that is pertinent to the story...... AND it's narrated in first person? You're telling me she never thinks about the fact that <spoiler>she's descended from the Heart Queen</spoiler> is related to the fact that she got stolen? EVER? And the audience doesn't even find out until the end because the author has decided that NOW we're going to have the MC start thinking about it. Which is nonsense. And, now that I'm thinking about it, it decreases my opinion about her intelligence. (I also found out she's like 5 years older than I thought she was, so...? Why is she more childish? Even more skeptical.)<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations have almost hit the ground for this genre, but whatever. Overall, this book didn't blow my mind, but I still enjoyed reading (most of) it! Honestly, that last bit in my last paragraph is really what's making me drop my review. 3.5 stars.",,,1,0

I was so excited in the beginning, but it only got worse. The world was incredibly interesting and felt unique, but that’s about the only thing that did. Nearly every plot point felt convenient/contrived, or even nonsensical. It felt like the only reason she stole her clan’s magic was so they could reject her and so she’d be accepted by the prince, and so she’d be magically powerful. Her magic doesn’t really even have a basis in terms of how it works? It just seems like it suits whatever she needs when she needs it. Moreover, the plot point with her father felt like it only existed to give her a reason to marry the prince.<br/><br/>As for the relationship, it was really annoying with the main character’s back and forth of “I love him, no I hate him, no he’s the hottest guy ever.” Just make up your damn mind! And when they finally get together, it doesn’t even feel earned– like he says he’s toootally in love with her but like… where on earth did it come from? The only thing that really developed was the hots they had for each other. I could’ve liked the relationship more if there was actual development and not “you want to fuck me so bad” and “no I don’t!!!!1!1!1!1!” every five pages.<br/><br/>Regarding the plot… where do I even start? It barely felt existent; everything happened just for them to get together. Her dad didn’t even feel relevant half the time because they weren’t even able to do anything about it for a solid section of the book! If a book is only going to be about romance, actually commit to it; don’t bother with turning what’s supposed to be the main plot into what feels like a background side quest. None of the reveals even felt interesting, either. They all felt decently predictable and not that overwhelming. And him “betraying” her at the end? It might’ve been me just not being interested in the book anymore, but I literally just did not care. A dick move of him, sure, but… I just didn’t feel anything.<br/><br/>Along with that, much of the actual goings-on that actually felt interesting was hidden from the MC because it was meant to be a secret. Which, yeah, sure, secrets can be fun, but not if that’s the only thing you’re dangling as a plot point beyond the father in the story. Unfortunately, the MC knowing nothing means that I know nothing. Which makes me extremely bored.<br/><br/>Moreover, what even was the point of her brother marrying one of the princes? Ignoring the fact that he fell in love with the prince in like two days, what’s even the purpose of him being there? He allegedly comes to help the main character along with be in love with his own prince, but he does practically nothing regarding finding their father! Though, truthfully, neither of them do much.<br/><br/>Overall, I was just… disappointed by this book. The unique world intrigued me so much in the beginning but it all went downhill after that. Not that interested in the sequel. 2 stars.",true,,1,0

I do want to preface this review the fact that I didn't really go into this book expecting anything, so I wasn't disappointed by it. However, one reviewer described this as a ""passion book"" and I agree. Don't start this if you want a more biology-oriented, hard science book. This has many anecdotes, stories, and philosophical tangents regarding fungi and the author's experiences with fungi. <br/><br/>I learned a lot about fungi that I didn't know before, especially regarding their importance in the environment and their heavy connections with plants. Seeing how difficult it is to talk about fungi without anthropomorphizing them was something I hadn't considered, and it's quite easy to understand the issue after learning about just how alien they are compared to humans. This book really opened my eyes to the complexities of fungi and how much we've ignored them in science in comparison to how huge they are in the Earth's ecosystem. <br/><br/>I love when I read non-fiction books that change how I think about things in my day-to-day life, and I definitely think this did that. I won't be able to go through a forest again without thinking about all the mycelium that must be running beneath my feet. (Another book that made me think similarly was Ed Yong's <i>I Contain Multitudes</i>, which I definitely recommend. Ed Yong also complimented this book!) I knew about mother trees prior to reading this, but this was on a different level.<br/><br/>Of course, I do have a few nitpicks when reading this. There are often moments when the author jumps from scientific topics and concepts to very philosophical ideas about such things and meandering thoughts about life and such. The first few times it was enjoyable to read, but by the end of the book I got a little weary after it happened like a dozen times; I read these books moreso for the science and less for philosophical ideas, so I just got kind of tired of that. And sometimes the information felt kind of repetitive. I get it, fungi are very good at connecting and sending chemicals/messages. And often sections would conclude with, ""well, they're obviously doing this but we don't know how!"" Okay...? The point is probably that they're quite in the dark on fungi-related research, but after the first few times it's like yeah... okay... you don't know. Great. <br/><br/>But still, overall, good book! I listened to the audiobook for the first 60% of this, and, as I've mentioned previously in my updates, the author himself narrating the book along with the passion you can clearly hear in the writing made me quite excited about the material. I really enjoyed most of the content and this was worth reading. Love books that open my eyes to new topics. 4 stars.",,,1,0

I think it'd be best to this in a pros and cons fashion, as it will make things easier.<br/><br/>First, the pros:<br/><br/>The religion and the associated worldbuilding in this story is INCREDIBLY fascinating. I love the clashing of all the religious sects that are under one main religion. The fact that they are all disagreeing about the interpretation of one religion rather than being multiple different ones is especially juicy and tense for the characters and plot. (And one reveal at the end makes things REALLY interesting for the founding of the religion, so I got really hooked by that.) As for the plot, I thought it was definitely intriguing. I'm always a fan of prophesied plots/characters and chosen ones in stories (though I know many aren't a fan of them), so seeing them here got me excited. I also love seeing prophecies get twisted because of wrong/different interpretations, so that was fun to read about. When exciting, action filled moments in this book happened, they did not let me down. Every scene that was meant to be tension-filled and thrilling genuinely had those characteristics, especially as a grimdark book. So when I got to those points, I was very excited to read them. However... that's pretty much most of the good I can say about the book.<br/><br/>Now, for the cons:<br/><br/>There's a lot to say here, but my biggest issues with this book were the bloat and the pacing. First of all, there is SO much info-dumping via dialogue or characters' thoughts that is often just way too much. There are many times where it's just paragraph upon paragraph of telling the reader what they should know instead of like... showing it by letting it play out through the scene? Moreover, there is so much bloat with information that is often just unnecessary and takes up time in the book. Hell, I think they could've cut like 100-200 pages from this book and it would've been pretty similar. Nothing interesting actually happens until, like, 25% of the way in. I was often just so bored reading through some of the POVs and waiting for characters to actually get on with the plot that I was solidly skimming heavily through some chapters. I didn't care! I honestly barely liked any of the POVs, and I often only started liking them because they were involved in an interesting plot – not because of the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Neither Jondralyn or Tala interested me as characters. Jondralyn seemed to get progressively more childish, which annoyed me to no end, while Tala actually seemed to mature – which did get interesting, but only in around the latter quarter of her POV. Nail was only interesting because he had an interesting plot surrounding him. I liked how he was different from his friends, but his initial whining and childishness got on my nerves. However, I think his POV will get more interesting in the series, especially because of something in the ending. As for Gault... his inner conflict and window to the other side was kind of interesting, but after being bored by his POV already then reading how he is lusting over a girl his daughter's age... I lost all interest. Moreover, that bit basically becomes his entire POV: thinking about his daughter and then being obsessed with a different girl of his daughter's age. Utterly uncompelling.<br/><br/>Adding onto characters, I think I've definitely been spoiled by other series, because holy shit, so many villains seem almost completely black and white! I'd say out of all the antagonists in this series, there are maybe one or two that are actually kind of morally grey. And even still, they lean more towards being completely bad than somewhere in the middle. <spoiler>Jondralyn and Tala's brother is found to be under someone's thumb because of his gay relationship with another character,</spoiler> which is sad, but every single other action he takes is quite awful and erratic, so I'm not sure that's much of a morally grey character and moreso feeling pity for that situation. (I was actually surprised there was any mention of non-straight relationships, considering how straight the book initially felt when I was reading. Though I'm not sure how well the concept is treated in-series...) The 'good guys' are more morally grey, but when we only get that from the 'good' side and then basically nightmarish people on the 'evil' side it's just not that strong. <br/><br/>I also have another small nitpick, but honestly, when it's a grimdark series, I think you should do better. There's a scene where <spoiler>Nail is fleeing from his entire town being (BRUTALLY) slaughtered and yet... he runs past this massacre</spoiler> for a solid five to ten minutes as if in a video game, not being touched at all until he's knocked out. Hello? We've gotten graphic descriptions of mutilation, decapitation, slitting throats and all the like and we get no injures on what we've basically designated our <spoiler>main character</spoiler>. Talk about plot armor (especially in a grimdark book!). You could argue that he has training, but when reading it it felt like dumb luck, and no training was ever mentioned to save him. That scene kind of threw me off when I was reading it.<br/><br/>Overall, this book – after finishing it – had an interesting plot and world bogged down by bloat, slow pacing, and meh characters. Cut 150 or so pages and you'd have a better book. I honestly felt like I was slogging through the book while reading it, and I really wasn't sure if I was actually going to continue with the series (I actually thought about DNFing because I was so bored). But after that ending and some consequences for some characters... I do really want to know what happens. I'm unsure whether or not to continue. I might just look for spoilers in others' reviews. After everything, I give this 3 stars.<br/><br/>Edit: Okay, apparently all the prophecies and chosen one thing is a <spoiler>misdirect and Nail's not even important? What the hell is the point of me getting invested in this then? Sure, subverted tropes </spoiler> can be good, but not when they're what hooked me in in the first place... Something similar was done in <spoiler>The Faithful and the Fallen</spoiler> but that series didn't have prophecies and chosen ones holding up the entire plot, so I wasn't as annoyed. I'm not continuing with this series.",,,1,0

If you’re looking for another murder mystery full of twists and turns, don’t read this. It's not going to be what you're looking for.<br/><br/>This book, while focusing a good amount on plot, mostly covers Pip dealing with everything she went through in book 1 and 2. PTSD, pill popping, etc. It basically uses the plot to carry out Pip’s character/character growth. Seeing how she’s changed and how differently she reacts to everything (especially with her distrust in police) is interesting, and the latter half of the book is a exhilarating, exciting rush to <spoiler>cover up a dead body</spoiler>, there were some nitpicks to be had.<br/><br/>First of all, this book was far more predictable than the previous installments. The antagonist felt extremely obvious and it was almost surprising when <spoiler>Pip didn’t get it.</spoiler> Moreover, it felt like Pip kept doing stupid things to make her <spoiler>get caught in the first place</spoiler>. She goes out on a run ALONE when she knows she has <spoiler>a SERIAL KILLER</spoiler> stalking her??? Hello??? So of course she <spoiler>gets caught... not sure what else I expected</spoiler>. So seeing her do stupid things such as these made me get annoyed. Moreover, her plan when she <spoiler>kills Jason Bell</spoiler> is definitely... far-fetched and feels less realistic compared to the previous installments in the series. So reading that definitely raised my brows. <br/><br/>Overall, I feel like this book definitely delivers on showing Pip's trauma after everything she's been through and how her experiences have changed her, but it doesn't really deliver as much on the plot, other than a heist-ish vibe of <spoiler>""time to frame someone else for this murder""</spoiler>. So, definitely different from the previous books, and those nitpicks I mentioned made me like this less even on its own, even though I enjoyed the heist vibes for the latter half of the book. Honestly, I'd still really like to see more out of this series and cast of characters, especially with that ending. 3.75 stars.",,,1,0

At least it wasn't as bad at <i>Nightbane.</i> But that's not saying much.<br/><br/>First of all, this book was... boring. Just really quite boring. The first section (about first ~40%) was Fallon being help captive by Dante, which was interesting at first, until it was clear that Dante (whom I barely remembered) was just a one-note villain with no other personality than being 100% evil. It was nice to see no holds barred on being evil, but once it was clear it was his entire personality, I just started getting annoyed. Moreover, the entire section consisted of Fallon saying she didn't want to do anything, Dante threatening her friend to make her do it, and then she does it. This happens like ten times, and by the fifth time I just wanted her to grow a spine or something. At least make it more interesting. <br/><br/>The second section consisted of her hanging out with Lore and... doing shit against Dante? Honestly, it was so bland that I honestly don't remember the specifics. I just remember something about them finding stones to defeat Dante (don't remember why) and then I also remember Lore and Fallon having a ton of sex.<br/><br/>The last, which I would barely call a section, consisted of defeating Dante. This was utterly disappointing because out of ~1300 pages on an ebook, I'd say defeating Dante probably took 50 pages. Extremely rushed, extremely one-note on Dante's personality again, and pretty boring. Then we immediately went to the happy ending (except for something with Fallon's mom... which I don't care about either...) and that was it. When the main villain is defeated in five seconds, I feel nothing.<br/><br/>What's unfortunate with this series is that I find the worldbuilding genuinely interesting. There might be holes that I'm noticing, but my standards are being interesting and not having blatantly obvious plotholes/worldbuilding holes. I like the Italy based world and the different cultures... but literally everything else is just not good. I liked the plot in the first book, I felt it was pretty interesting – and when some remnants of that feeling popped up here, I got excited, but everything just feels boring now, especially coupled with the rest of the book. Some of the information throughout the story is interesting, but every time we get interesting information it is almost ALWAYS info-dumped through giant conversations that happen for like 10 pages (out of ~1300 in an ebook). It's just characters sitting around and spewing out a bunch of information to move the plot on. Can things just happen so we can find out about these things naturally???<br/><br/>As for characters, everything about this series would be better with a different main character. Fallon is so stupid and childish, and reading from her POV is extremely annoying. Moreover, having dramatic, formal dialogue contrasted with Fallon literally saying ""whatevs"" creates a horribly disjointed feeling in the vibes Wildenstein is trying to write for the story. Pick a lane, because having this modern slang in this kind of story is just VERY weird. Moreover, it emphasizes the incredibly teenager-y feeling Fallon gives off– and contrasted with the fact that Lore called her ""Little Bird"" and that he's like hundreds of years old is such an ick. Usually I'm fine with these sorts of things because it's unrealistic (no one is 900 years old) and usually characters are of a similar maturity for me to ignore it, but dear god I don't like this one. She does gain more maturity in this book, but even still, she's so annoyingly childish and idiotic at times that I still can't stand it.<br/><br/>Building on issues with Fallon, in this book she awakens her magic... and everything about it is just not great? First of all, she basically knows how to use it immediately without ANY learning curve AND it's like there's no rules?? Sometimes she has to draw certain runes to do things... but other times she can just ""draw gills"" on her neck to breathe?? It's that easy?? Everything with blood magic feels created just to do whatever the plot needs. Moreover, she learns the languages of her family (Shabbin, Crow) like... immediately after she awakens her magic? It just feels like it cheapens those languages so much if you just know them because of magic.<br/><br/>As for Lore... he literally doesn't show up for half of the book. Now, I don't really care for Lore because I find him one-note (definitely in this book) and boring, but surely that's part of the draw for readers? As for Lore's one-note-ness, his entire personality in this book is just being possessive of Fallon and getting horny for her. Literally every conversation between Lore and Fallon was ""I love you,"" ""don't leave me ever again,"" or ""don't you dare do that stupid thing, Fallon!"" Utterly uninteresting.<br/><br/>Regarding side characters... I really think the cast is too big, and I don't think it's just because I barely remember who most of these people are. There are SO many names and people that are constantly rotating and it kind of makes my head spin. <br/><br/>Those were my general comments, but honestly, there was this really weird part in the end where one half of a mated gay couple dies and the other half wants to live ""as a forever crow"" (essentially not wanting to live) and the reason he gives (and other characters give) for not having attachments to stay alive is... not having kids?? WTF?? Literally the gay character says that Fallon's father is only staying alive without his mate because of Fallon... and that could be like ""oh Fallon is so important to him"" but no, it's mentioned beforehand that the reasoning given for his suicide-ish decision is because he doesn't have kids??? If your partner dies and you don't have kids, your friends don't matter?? I guess all the characters' conclusions is that only kids matter and kids are SOO much more important and not any other connections you've made in your life??? WTF??? Whatever, maybe I'm reading too much into this but that situation seriously weirded me out. Especially with what I'm nearly 100% sure is a gay couple??? <br/><br/>I might say that this was better than the second book, but honestly the second book was so plotless that I literally don't remember what happened. I just remember being annoyed with Fallon's idiocy, someone getting shot... and that's literally it. So I unfortunately can't compare it, but this book was just not fun. Some bits were mildly interesting and alright, but overall it was just skim, skim, skim. 2 stars.",true,,1,0

Not a lot really happened plot-wise, unlike book one. And even though something happened at the end, it felt like less of a cliffhanger and more like the ending for this book was unfinished. This definitely feels like a filler book. However, the relationship development was not abysmal, if not a bit rocky.

I do like the reveal about one of the characters, and there were shocking things happening to characters that I didn’t expect (including deaths) so I did enjoy the fact that the author had the balls to do so. Still, if this book had sped the plot up a whole lot I would’ve fully enjoyed this.

I solidly enjoyed the first, but maybe I've been reading too many well-written high fantasy books because this was BAD!<br/><br/>There are just so many bad things to say about this book. The characters, the plot, the relationships... I barely even liked anything. First: the characters. I'm used to MCs in other New Adult genre books making kind of stupid decisions at times, but dear god, Isla just behaved like a child! She made so many idiotic and emotional decisions it was like she was a teenager, not a grown adult. She kept thinking that Grim is evil and 100% doing bad things... even though from her memory it's clear that he's not 100% evil? But, okay, sure, she's blinded by her emotions and wanting to do what's right or whatever... but then she runs off to seduce Grim even when it's clearly a bad, dangerous and stupid idea? And then she prioritizes what she wants over, like, everything, and basically does whatever she wants. Drove me nuts. And... she's not even interesting? Like, I don't know, anything not generic to the genre felt childish, which I'll talk about later (and actually, it's one of the good parts!). But that's just the MC. Now, to talk about side characters, I have to talk about the plot.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot covers like... 2.5 things? The first is that there's a rebel plot going on in the background trying to stop them... because why? We don't figure out why until like 70% in. It's a generic plotline and basically does nothing for most of the book. The second plot is the war Isla believes is going to happen against Grim. And when we see Isla trying to recruit side characters to join her side in the war... they're literally so one-note? They basically all agree with her and have the exact same opinion, except for maybe one character who turns out to be leading the rebels, anyway. Basically EVERY character is so one-note except for Grim and Isla. Leading from that, our third plot is then Isla recovering her memories from her time with Grim. And we can tell that THAT is the favorite plotline of our author because it's obviously the most developed.<br/><br/>The politics is barely there – which consists of generic squabbling until there is some personality, which is then shoved under the rug for more Grim and Isla development. Sure, the war plotline is basically supporting the Grisla (?) plotline, but it's on its last legs. Somebody feed it some broth or something, because it was made of straw for all it felt it was worth. If the war plot was at all there, it was pretty boring for its generic-ness because... I just didn't care? Either it was going to be how Isla said it was (Grim is leading the war against them) – in which case, generic and boring – or it won't be, which is also expected because we spend the entire book learning about the relationship between Grim and Isla (i.e., he's not actually evil is the alternate ending, which was expected).<br/><br/>Speaking of Grisla, throughout the first 50% of the book, I literally did NOT care about Grim. There has been no reason to care about him other than Isla being horny... perhaps he should've been developed as a legitimate love interest in the first book so I could care about him? Instead, the author spends like 60% of this book JUST developing Grisla! (I'm writing Grisla so it's easier to type, don't sue me for the name.) And the reason we can't have all her memories back in one go is SO contrived; the reason given is JUST ""well magic doesn't work that way"" and it's SO obvious it's only like that so half of the book can actually exist instead of putting effort into the war plot! I don't know, maybe it's not contrived, but when you spend half your book on literally just memory flashbacks... try harder.<br/><br/>But I'll be honest, Grisla did win me over... because it feels like romance is the only thing Aster can write moderately well. The scenes did have a decent slowburn... only because I suppose they weren't horny 100% of the time (maybe I'm just used to even worse slowburn...). However, I think I also cared about Grim because Isla's relationship with Oro WASN'T DEVELOPED AT ALL!!! Remember when I said characters were one-note???. Dear god, it was practically EASY to care about Grim because Oro's personality consisted of <i>*wet dog eyes* Isla... I wuv you... don’t do bad things.... also I want to have sex with you but we can't... *sobs into his crown or whatever, idc*.</i> I did like Oro in the first book, but his personality became so one-dimensional in this book. Probably because he was barely there.<br/><br/>And as for attachment to relationships... it was so hard to START caring about any relationship development because it felt like everything was immediately just going to be horny. I was proved (slightly) wrong with Grisla, but yeah... eventually things get horny after not that much development. Grisla was better than most, but honestly... it was not amazing. I felt some attachment to it, but it was more of ""this is better than the rest of the book"" attachment. If anything, Grisla felt like a fast-paced slow burn, because every memory scene is SOLELY focused on their relationship. In any other situation, I'd like the relationship drama, but Oro is so underdeveloped there's hardly any room to care and Grim was just horny in the first book anyway, so I barely cared in the beginning. The relationship with grim felt better and more genuine at 80% but like… that was at 80%.<br/><br/>With all this focus on Grisla, it really feels like Aster just keeps forgetting which plot they want to tell. I get the setup of flashbacks and changing personality, but honestly, if you're going to do that, put some oomph into the actual plot! It's SO boring and generic! I literally don't care (because of reason explained above)!<br/><br/>Now, one of the good things I did like about Isla was the moderate corruption arc (?). It's unique! It's interesting! But honestly... since Isla was so childish it felt more like her being an idiot than her trying to gain strength or do what she thinks is right. Moreover, part of her ""corruption"" is like... just doing things Grim does... and the audience can clearly tell he's not that evil, especially with Grim and Isla like being horny af in the first book, then it's just kind of confusing. It's so hard to actually tell if it's supposed to be any kind of corruption arc because the messages I'm getting from her character development are so confusing. There's a point where she gets memories back and realizes she can turn pain into power, and it's clearly not a good things, so, okay, corruption. But then... she gets memories back where her past self is like ""pain isn't the way to power."" Sure, character growth is a thing, but that's just kind of inserting whatever you want without actual development in her character. It seems like she's meant to be doing bad things with her power and making bad choices, but then... she picks Grim, who's been revealed to not be that bad at all? It's all mixed signals and I'm honestly kind of confused.<br/><br/>Apparently, there's a sequel? I really didn't like this all that much, but with the ending of leaving with Grim, I'm kind of curious what's going to happen... but honestly, not by all that much. Maybe I'll read other people's reviews.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't have much fun with this book. Here and there, I liked some moments, but this book is trying to be ACOTAR (which I liked and I felt had understandable character and relationship progress!) and it's just worse. Read ACOTAR instead if you want the same plot but better. 1.5 stars.",true,,1,0

In other words, this felt like reading a murder mystery. Chapter after chapter, threads were being woven together to create one exhilarating, explosive finale! Well, maybe not <i>explosive</i>, but definitely something that had my heart beating fast, waiting to see how everything was going to turn out (even though I generally knew already what happened at the end!). I was originally going to give this 4 stars for a solid read, but man that ending was giving me palpitations! Reading about all the crazy things Holmes did (stalking former employees?? threatening financial ruin via lawsuits??) was intense and kind of frightening, but I'm glad that her fraud was eventually revealed. Seeing so many people fall in line behind her was also worrisome, especially considering everything these days with Sam Bankman-Fried... yikes! Regardless, great book – and surprisingly felt a bit short? But it seems it told all the story it needed to tell. Glad to see Holmes got consequences for her actions. 4.5 stars.",,,1,0

It was just… hard to <i>care</i>. Characters kept telling stories about themselves and then dying as if they should’ve had an impact, but when they’re introduced literally 10 minutes ago in a novella, I just don’t care about them. I don’t feel any emotional stakes because I know the characters I like/know already are going to live because this is a prequel, and anyone that dies is someone that’s been just introduced. What is the purpose of writing this when we already know the outcome? We get more insight into Aeson, but that could’ve easily been done in the main series and without this novella in which half is wasted. For most of this, it’s supposed to be some great and dangerous journey, but when you’re just killing off characters that we’re only told we’re supposed to care about (through dialogue like “she was only 20…” when the character being mentioned had two lines of dialogue and one appearance), I just don’t feel anything. It’s fun being in this world, but it just doesn’t have urgency or stakes. <br/><br/>The book only started getting genuinely interesting at literally 67% of the way in. We were finally getting scenes with characters I cared about, interesting lore, and unexpected information. Honestly, it’s kind of a deus ex machina situation, but at least it’s a surprise and it’s far more interesting than simply getting an egg and leaving. After 67%, nearly everything was pretty exciting to read because it had characters that were actually developed throughout the entire book and/or were ones I actually cared about. <br/><br/>I was going to give this 2.5 stars, but since the latter section of the book pretty much made up for every single other uninteresting part, this gets 3.25 stars.",,,1,0

Compared to the previous two books, this was definitely more character focused, but it was extremely well done in a way that didn’t make me bored at all.<br/><br/>I am going to be honest, some of the book did feel a little Christian-y 'preachy' because ""oooo~ all the gods aren't proven to be real, but the religion where there is <i>one</i> god is the one that <spoiler>reveals itself to be truuuue!

This time we had more going on… I think, though I am docking .25 stars from what it would’ve been had it not been quite slow in the first 50%. While it didn’t crawl, it did take quite a while to actually pick up the pace – in a way that I was wondering whether or not I should DNF if it was going to be that uninteresting. But it luckily picked up after that, leading to a really exciting antagonist. But honestly… it feels like very little happened? Granted, much of the book focused on character development, but even that felt like it happened in the latter 40%. Before that I felt like we were going either very slowly or in circles regarding the plot and Saffron’s interactions with the antagonist. Still, not a bad book. I also like that the romantic relationship still had some tension in things to work through, because I often worry about series where the romance is finished by the second book in the series, because either it becomes boring for me or there’s forced miscommunication.

However, the atmosphere, worldbuilding, and relationship are still top notch, and the ending is incredibly exciting. Wish the rest of the book was more like it. 3.5 stars.",,,1,0

The worldbuilding is very interesting, the characters' machinations are interesting to follow, the plot overall seems like it's going somewhere intriguing... but by GOD does this book <i>crawl</i>.<br/><br/>It would be inaccurate to say that reading this book is like watching paint dry. This is more like as if someone took a very interesting episode of a TV show and slowed it down by 200 percent. I <i>know</i> that interesting stuff is <i>going</i> to happen, I know that this build up is creating interesting plot threads... but holy shit, can we go a little faster? I keep seeing reviews saying it gets more interesting and better paced in the last 200 pages or 20 percent or whatever, but I literally cannot keep reading conversation after conversation that develops maybe 2% of the plot each time they happen. AND each conversation is padded with dozens of descriptions that are <i>nice,</i> but when compared with the already slow pacing, it just annoys. I like the courtly intrigue, I like the scheming, I like the characters (even with SO many names it was hard to keep track of who was who within the first 200 pages), but I cannot keep going with this DRAG. Some people said if you liked Game of Thrones you should read this, but Games of Thrones' pacing is far better. The build up and pacing certainly is.<br/><br/>Moreover, the attempt at mimicking Tolkien via ""this is a translation"" felt weak, since all that's translated is stuff like ""this is a type of bird"" or ""this is a plant,"" instead of cultural or historical knowledge of the world. Building on that, the ""translations"" feel exceptionally stupid sometimes – turning ""bamboo"" into ""babu""? Why? What is the purpose of that – to make your world feel exotic or something? I don't know. Not a fan. It was initially interesting with the more unique names, but after seeing sohju and babu... meh.<br/><br/>I really wish I could keep going in this book – and perhaps if there were fewer pages between where I am and the ending, I could. But I just can't slog through another 200 pages of barely anything. And while the spoilers did seem rather interesting... I just can't. I'd rather read something that fully engages me. It's such a shame, too, because I actually initially felt quite interested in the book! But after seeing reviews saying it barely speeds up until the end... sigh. Maybe I'll come back to this?

It’s a low bar, but the character interactions were realistic and that made me happy. It was a well-written slow burn that was ACTUALLY a slow burn, unlike some books these days... but don't go into this expecting a book about romance. The plot and characters are first and foremost. The world was also extremely interesting. However, while I was obsessed with this book, there were a few low points. <br/><br/>First, the shtick of having empaths be these weak-ish pacifists that can’t even commit self defense was interesting at first, but it gradually got a bit tiring when it kept getting mentioned for shits and giggles. <br/><br/>Second, the mystery and names of different characters grew convoluted enough that it was often hard to follow what was happening in the mystery. Just a lot of names and places and things happening made them confusing. <br/><br/>Third, though this is a personal preference, when it was made clear that empaths could literally <spoiler>get what’s called a “corruption” arc, the MC only got partially corrupted, and not even personality wise?? Man, that made me annoyed. I thought we’d get more of a stronger personality. We got a flash of it, but it was quickly gone.</spoiler><br/><br/>And lastly, while the allure of Evan/the Dead Man as a mysterious figure/character was there in the beginning, it got a little tiring along with the pacifist shit for shits and giggles. I don’t mind it being used for plot, world building, or character development, but the constant comedic quips were getting annoying. The rest of this book was SO addicting, but there were these points I wasn’t fully happy with. This book really does contain such an interesting world. Can’t wait to see what happens in the sequel! 4.25 stars.<br/><br/>Side note: the world building technically does feel a bit flimsy, but it's interesting and enticing enough for me to not care too much about it.

I think this book was better than the first! Talk about the opposite of second book syndrome! The pacing felt better – or it might just be that I devoured this book. I really liked how McDonald explored how difficult dealing with trauma and relationships can actually be, and it shows the MC actually fucking up a lot. I liked seeing characters actually dying and suffering because it felt more real and less plot armory. <br/><br/>I loved all the twists so much too! Extremely engaging and I ate them all up so quickly. However, I do feel like the <spoiler>""guy that seems to be on the MC's side is actually the bad guy""</spoiler> from the first book was just redone here. However, it was strong enough that the similarities didn't bother me too much, and I was satisfied with the reveal – even though I could see it coming.<br/><br/>A couple completely subjective issues I was a bit annoyed with were the romance and the powers that characters get. One, after a while I felt like the romance was getting a bit boring in the sense that I felt like there should've been more <i>drama</i>. I liked the <spoiler>potentially two? love interests, but having Raine's issues get in the way of their relationship(s) was interesting and I was hoping there was going to be permanent consequences for that... but then it worked out in the end? So I was bored again. Now they're happy and it's not as interesting.</spoiler> As for the powers, I have a tendency to only want the MC to be special, so seeing the male love interest get Special™ powers too was something I was annoyed with...</spoiler> But again, completely subjective! Just my personal preferences.<br/><br/>Overall, incredible book, I read it in one day! Don't stay up until 3 am! 4.75 stars!<br/><br/>Side note: I feel like I'm underselling how insane this book made me feel in this review. I need to EAT this book. Holy shit.<br/><br/>Edit 2: I also thought that <spoiler>Raine was going to get pregnant because she was sleeping with the heir of another house (forget his name) and that was going to become a plot point... but I guess I just live for drama ",,,1,0

I eat that shit up because it's DRAMATIC – and because otherwise your romantic relationship is resolved by the first book and you have not a lot going there for strong development for the rest of the series. So I thought, awesome, that's what's happening here. And it was the ONLY thing only my interest for this book, because holy shit did Signa and Death's relationship get lovey-dovey boring and I barely cared about the murder mystery.

Likely nothing I'll care too much about. I was apprehensive about reading Foxglove anyway because I knew the romance was resolved... and I guess I was proven right. RIP to everyone else who got hyped about Blythe because she was the most competent and engaging character (which, pretty much true honestly), but I just... don't care. I get focused on main characters anyway. I wish I could continue this series, but honestly that review just took any engagement away from me. I'm not the type of reader that moves onto different main characters, but honestly <spoiler>enemies to lovers with reincarnation</spoiler> is my jam.

I didn’t really care about whether his personality showed through strongly enough or not because the world building itself was just so fascinating. Of course, I did hate when he was a bastard. There were references to how he would act in the OG series, but honestly they felt too meta and kind of forced. I thought it was interesting seeing the world shape Snow and seeing how his life and Katniss’ matched up in hidden ways; that was fun. Perhaps if I read this again the plot/characters would not be engaging, but as I’ve said: I LOVED the world building. <br/><br/>Maybe my second most liked thing was having Snow’s friend contrast Snow so much to bring out both their characteristics. Foiling? Either way, I liked it. <br/><br/>People also said they would’ve thought a Lucy Gray POV would’ve been more interesting, which, fair – I might agree that it would’ve been more engaging, but I feel like we already sort of got that with Katniss. I think seeing a POV from the capitol was interesting simply because it contrasted with one we’ve already seen and it provides information we haven’t seen before, especially at the beginning of the Hunger Games. 4 stars.",,,1,0

Honestly, I think I was more engaged with the information I was seeing about what the 60s were like with all those pesticides – and it made me very glad this book was published! I think it was both surprising and not surprising to see that the pesticides weren't really even working against insects and yet they were still being used. (Lobbying is my guess.) The last chapter about alternative methods was also really intriguing from a modern perspective, as I've read about methods being used today to counteract insects (I believe it was making disease-carrying mosquitos infertile with the Wolbachia bacteria, in Ed Yong's I Contain Multitudes.

While I loved the concept of the romantic relationship, I felt the pacing was weird sometimes – mostly it was fine, but sometimes it felt like Teo's negative feelings were unnecessary when <spoiler>the other guy (can't remember his name)</spoiler> was doing nothing negative. It makes sense that Teo holds resentment, but either develop the relationship or start to regress it, not have the same beats over and over again with Teo's negative misinterpretations of situations. I also felt that Teo's issues <spoiler>with his wings</spoiler> wasn't developed fully. He talks about it being an issue and it's brought up once or twice, but <spoiler>almost instantly fixed (and the reasoning for why they're fixed doesn't really make sense or hold up with any pre-explained world building). I barely got the sense that he had a big issue with his wings.</spoiler><br/><br/>The world building felt lush and lacking at the same time. Everything was <i>fascinating</i>, yet I felt like we only got a glimpse before moving onto the next thing. I would've loved a more developed  world – having Teo's town itself be explored in the beginning felt like the most fleshed out area before we moved on.<br/><br/>Moreover, I would not advertise this book as YA. It was wayyyy too simple writing, I would've said middle grade or between middle grade and young adult for the content itself (and it has swears). I was expecting something more hardcore, more hunger games style, but it was really simple and rather... cheery. I often forgot that someone was going to be sacrificed unless people started getting sad or it was explicitly brought up in the text.<br/><br/>The ending also kind of threw me off, because I was expecting <spoiler>to have the whole ""human sacrifice"" thing proved to be wrong and that they were sacrificing people for no reason, because Teo's (and other characters') entire conflict with the trials is that sacrificing people is a horrible thing to do. Yet he/the world gets punished for not following through with killing someone? The message that sacrificing someone is actually the correct thing to do is a strange thing to say. However, I did like that the author had the balls to do so. I do enjoy a plotline where the MC fucks up and has to deal with the consequences. </spoiler><br/><br/><spoiler> The fact that Teo and his boyfriend are going to go and save the world felt very strange as well; I know the defense was that the gods had to stay in their home cities to defend them, but it felt unrealistic to have the gods say out loud that they ""can't send children"" and do it anyway, expecting them to save the day. Maybe I would've felt it was more reasonable if the gods were more terrified or stressed about the kids instead of giving up after one defense.</spoiler><br/><br/>Still, I definitely can't say I didn't enjoy this book. I zoomed through it and finished it in one day, after all. I loved Teo, Xio and Niya's interactions, and especially the mostly-good development with <spoiler>Teo's boyfriend (sorry, I still can't remember his name).</spoiler> The world was extremely exciting, and I loved seeing a society where it was normal for people to transition, and to have GNC gods. I liked the author's take that even though Teo <spoiler>got top surgery, he still got dysphoria from his wings. A unique way to handle it, and to connect the (possibly binder-wearing) reader to him while keeping him consistent with the world building.</spoiler> I loved the unique trials and seeing how Teo was going to manage through by the end. 4.25 stars.",,,1,0

The steampunk-fantasy world and worldbuilding is INCREDIBLY interesting, especially with the addition of dragons and the unique magic system. However, out of the three POVs, I only wanted to read two – Hilmore was so boring and technical military-wise that I literally skipped his chapters after a bit. Lisanne’s POV is the most interesting and Clay’s had me hanging on by a couple threads, but his was mind numbing. Moreover, with such an interesting world, it shames me to say that I had almost no interest in the plot. I had theories in my head that kept me going, but after looking up spoilers, I had no motivation to keep reading. The antagonist just seems so one-dimensional and I’m not really interested in seeing what’s going to happen to the characters if that’s going to be the main enemy. And having a POV I have no interest in reading wasn’t helping. I wish I was still interested in this, and maybe I’ll come back to it, but I doubt it.",,,0,0

The relationship did not purely consist of lust and therefore was something I could enjoy. I loved the way the fae were written in this book, especially with all the laws they were constricted to, as well as the world they lived in. The writing was often very beautiful and descriptive.<br/><br/>However, some things held me back from giving this a higher rating. While I know it occurs in real life sometimes, it’s difficult for me to believe that they fell head over heels in love with each other within… a week? While the relationship feels like they have something genuine going and not too contrived, it still feels held back by the fact that they’ve had literally barely any time to develop an actual relationship. Moreover, the restriction against them getting together – the “Good Law” – feels utterly contrived. Perhaps if there were more proof that this law was “needed,” I would see it as more of part of the world, but I couldn’t. <br/><br/>And when were they ever enemies? The summary implies that they’re going to be enemies for a good while but that happens only for a chapter or two. Their relationship felt real enough for me to not hate it once the enemies thing disappeared, but it was really annoying that I was expecting some sort of enemies to lovers when it wasn’t.<br/><br/>One thing I did enjoy was the MC’s awareness of her own feelings and danger of them in this world… thankfully she wasn’t forced to be stupid in order to get the plot moving (although that happened once or twice).<br/><br/>The world was also not as fleshed out as I’d hoped – while the details that we were given were very interesting, they often felt surface level and not really built into what was happening. The Wild Hunt was there… but why, exactly? They were in constant danger but the only way I felt that was through another character’s injuries, not the MC’s, and since it didn’t really feel like I understood the extent of his powers, I wasn’t really feeling the amount of danger they were in.<br/><br/>And the ending felt kind of obvious and quick – and they defeated the antagonist so quickly it kind of felt like he wasn’t even the antagonist in the first place, which was kind of annoying.<br/><br/>I suppose I could call this something akin to a fairytale to explain it all away – it felt short and whimsical with a happy ending. But I still wasn’t fully satisfied, even though I generally enjoyed this book. 3.75 stars.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

I just felt like I couldn’t connect to Varg. The issue with his sister has vanished, and his only character development is bonding with the Bloodsworn. After a certain point, it feels like his scenes exist just to tell us what’s going on.

Truthfully, if she’s not in most of the third book or she’s just dead completely and all we do is follow her kid, I’m not interested.

This is probably my biggest issue, and since this book is a romantacy, it was also a huge chunk of the book. First of all, anyone who describes this book as “enemies to lovers” is exaggerating or lying. When were they enemies? She sees Xaden and almost immediately starts undressing him with her eyes. At no point before they get together does she not think “oh my god, he’s so hot.” The MC thinks he hates her, which is believable for maybe their first and second interaction, but after that the thought is ridiculous– which is the extent of the “enemies” part of their relationship.<br/><br/>Moreover, Xaden is your cliche, arrogant MMC who goads and taunts the FMC 24/7, making her go “he’s so hot while doing it though” a million times over, which really ground my gears. And he calls her VIOLENCE?? Which absolutely made me cringe every time I read it.<br/><br/>While I liked the <spoiler>tension of the love triangle and it being set up in a similar way to ACOTAR,</spoiler> the pacing was absolutely terrible. It’s definitely not anything like a slow burn. She practically starts eye-fucking him by the third time they see each other, and he joins in soon afterwards (before they start actually fucking).<br/><br/>My second issue, while more minor, is just how irritating/stupid Violet could be at times. Most of it was just losing her mind over Xaden every time he walked into a room. But one thing that really bothered me was that she was SO against killing people. Even people that are trying to kill her!! That use their opportunity at life again to TRY AND KILL HER AGAIN!! And still, she spares their lives?? <spoiler>And when she finally kills someone who’s been attempting to kill her a million times over, she breaks down.</spoiler> Isn’t she supposed to be smart? I get the emotional reaction, but after letting/wanting to let so many would-be murderers go, she felt more stupid than anything.<br/><br/>And speaking of Violet’s character… she did not really feel 20 years old. If you took out the swearing and the sex/references to sex, the behavior of the characters and the writing of the book would make it a YA book. That’s how immature things sometimes felt.<br/><br/>As for the rest of it– I loved the dragons and the worldbuilding regarding the magic here and there, but once we got to the reveal/ending, I just… didn’t care? Like it felt kind of obvious, and I didn’t really feel any sense of urgency or danger for any of the main characters. I knew they were probably going to get out of it fine. <spoiler>When she was poisoned,</spoiler> I was like, “Oh, maybe they’ll be some consequences for her!” But… nope. She healed from it really quickly. I mean, with the reveal at the VERY end it makes sense, but still… what was actually impacted except for the reveal? But I did like the reveal at the very end, it did make me really intrigued.<br/><br/>I have no idea if I’m actually going to read the next book, but if the plot actually gets good I might read it. Since the “enemies to lovers” “slow burn” romance already happened, I’m not really interested in the rest of it, and generally I feel like everything else is going to be decently predictable. Ordinarily, as long as it’s fun I’ll read, but right now I’m just bored.<br/><br/>3 stars.",,,1,0

I genuinely enjoyed this book! Loved that slow, slow burn and a well written romance. (Funnily enough, I actually DNF'd this in the past because it was <i>too</i> slow, but I really needed something good...)<br/><br/>I really like that the FMC actually has life issues other than dealing with her romantic relationship – and it creates angst, which I liked reading about! I also liked her having her own goals and standing up for herself regarding her work.<br/><br/>The MMC is an ass initially, but honestly I think I liked it because it makes him being warm/nice all the better and more rewarding.<br/><br/>However, I do have some more negative things to say.<br/><br/>I kind of feel like the book either slows down in the last 25% or gets a little bit aimless, not sure. It just didn’t feel like it had the exciting momentum of the rest of the book (though that might’ve been me). <br/><br/>And one thing that really did genuinely irritate me was that the FMC realizes <spoiler>she’s fallen in love with the MMC at the end and starts getting distressed that she’s in love and he isn’t, and that she’ll only get five more years with him. The thing is, that would make more sense from her perspective IF HE DIDN’T KISS HER OF HIS OWN VOLITION??? </spoiler><br/><br/>It’s really kinda stupid that she thinks he still doesn’t love her <spoiler> after kissing her?? And she thinks it’s going to be over after five years when she could just ask him if he wanted to stay together. Granted it’d be difficult/different if he wasn’t in love with her, but he obviously is and Zapata creates this contrived reasoning for her not to realize he’s in love with her (she practically ignores the kiss??). I honestly thought I’d been hallucinating reading that kiss scene because it felt like it hadn’t even happened – but then the FMC thinks about it and is like “surely that meant something” – uh, yeah, girl! He fucking kissed you! Idiot! </spoiler><br/><br/>Anyway, that section of the book at the end was really irritating, but thankfully it was obviously resolved and then I thought their relationship was cute again. <br/><br/>4 stars.",,,1,0

Having “strong women” doesn’t mean being absolute bitches to men/others. You don’t need to put down men to uplift women. Women are not aliens compared to men, and vice versa (Surprise! People are just nuanced). Considering I’ve seen reviews that implies this both continues and gets worse throughout the series in different ways, not sure I want to continue it. Would much rather read Brandon Sanderson. <br/><br/>I don’t know if I’d rather read a series with fun scenes and no women compared to badly written women (for the most part), but the fact that I’d consider it says something. Pissed. <br/><br/>Thing is, I really did enjoy mostly everything else. Rand’s continual denial of being the Dragon got irritating after a while, even if it made sense. Where is the growth? I’d rather a bunch of scenes be cut than have him be angry for the 15th time about others saying he’s the Dragon. And this book was very long.

However, there is the chance that the length will turn other people away. But since both books have been rich with characterization and world building to make up for a long plot or otherwise, I personally won’t complain about my experience. (When I did lag in my interest, it only happened around twice in this book.)<br/><br/>The world building is extremely engaging as always, and the pieces are finally slowly coming together regarding the overarching plot. While some may complain about Kvothe’s extreme perfection at everything, I find it extremely entertaining to watch a character struggle but always manage to slip out in the end. Most of the characters are, as always, very fun to read about. <br/><br/>However, throughout the series I’ve found myself getting increasingly annoyed and bored with Denna. She continuously strings him along for years and they practically have nothing in common– remind me, again, why he is in love with her? Their only commonality is music, which is just often enough touched upon that you remember it instead of all the moments she’s spurned him or run away. I tire of this relationship. The several pages where Kvothe solves some of a mystery with Fela has a more charismatic and fun relationship than whatever bland/forced nonsense he has with Denna. It’s completely uninteresting.<br/><br/>Still, the complaints I had from the previous book are mostly resolved in this one. It was nice to get a breath of fresh air from the University in this book, but it doesn’t even get into the summary’s main plot until a good while in. (Though considering the rest of the writing, I couldn’t help but be drawn in). We finally spend some time beyond baby’s first character development/background and get out into the world. And while we did get more information about the Chandrian, I still felt it to be a little bit lacking. While I understand the urge to keep things hidden (as I do in my own writing), I still felt that we barely got any information at all. Normally I wouldn’t complain all that much, but we are 2/3 of the way into the series and this book was over 2000 pages on my ebook on my phone. Yes, this story is devoted to telling the story of the character Kvothe, the plot also exists to spur him forward. Where is the flesh of it?<br/><br/>Regardless, these, emotionally, are small complaints. My biggest one is Denna, and it might just be personal opinion rather than the writing. Overall an excellent book and series and, while I would like to read the third, it doesn’t appear to be coming anytime soon. 4.5 stars.",,,1,0

It has minute typos all over the book, which doesn't make it unreadable but they are noticeable enough. Literally everything is told, not shown, and almost always through giant chunks of dialogue. The relationship is practically insta-love, but almost nonsensically because <spoiler>Vali killed Ailsa's entire family</spoiler> and she falls in love with him like a day later. Any romantic development happens almost instantly. <br/><br/>Moreover, Ailsa's wolf, Ivor, only exists because she's relevant to the plot and nothing else. We don't see any connection between Ivor and Ailsa, and the former shows up 14% into the book. All she does is create useless conflict with Ailsa and Vali, and then she reveals a plot point later on (again, through giant chunks of dialogue). This is a book about romance, not plot. I would've DNF'd this at 20% if I didn't want people to know how awful this book is.

It felt like the cliche revenge training montage you’d see in any grimdark fantasy. Another reviewer said it felt very repetitive, and I definitely agree. It felt like the plot would get to a high point, making me excited, then lull extremely quickly, making me bored again. I felt like I was reading it passively than actually being interested in the plot or anything going on. Even when the plot actually progressed to the ending, it wasn’t anything particularly shocking or interesting to me even if I didn’t expect it. It was nice to see that characters didn’t fully have plot armor, however. <br/><br/>Moreover, seeing Tau’s character change from <spoiler> “surrender is for cowards” to “we need peace” </spoiler> within one or two pages was a little strange. <br/><br/>I felt like the magic system was interesting, but as others have said, the caste system feels lowkey superficial. All the times we see the higher castes degrading the lower castes feels like it only occurs within personal relationships. It doesn’t feel structural. But it doesn’t feel nonexistent, so there’s points for that.<br/><br/>The ending makes me intrigued with what’s going to happen in the rest of the series, but I think not enough to actually read the second book. Another reviewer said it changes from a training montage to an interesting political thriller within the last 30%, and I agree. If only that had been the entirety of the book and not just the last 30%!! Even with that, I just can’t bring myself to care about what will happen regarding the plot or the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a large chunk of this book character-wise felt very cliche.

It just didn’t feel fleshed out enough. It talked so much about Fallen discrimination, but the only bit we see is a couple scenes containing individual discrimination against Celeste. Moreover, since the plot was so fast, everything just felt just convenient enough for Celeste to get what she needed. Too convenient, really. It didn’t feel like the stakes were big enough. The romantic relationship didn’t have any weight because it didn’t feel like there was any build up for it. I literally didn’t care about the ending with their relationship because it was barely there. The ending/climax itself felt really abrupt and almost bafflingly in how quick and easy it ended. However, like I said before, I did like the concept of it all. The general plot was intriguing and I liked the world, but the execution fell really flat.<br/><br/>2.5 stars verging on 3.",,,1,0

However, what stuck out was the relationships between the characters, the atmosphere, and the lore – which is why I'm not giving a complete 1 star.

The only interesting thing was the worldbuilding in like, the first 20-30%, until it devolved into nothing but romance and weird possessiveness. The reveal at the end was completely expected but a fun one. Not at all interested in continuing this series. 1.5 stars.",,,1,0

The romance does feel fast, but considering how everything else (conflicts, rapport) is really good, it’s not too big a deal for me. The disconnect between the wolf storyline and the prince feels rather odd at first, but once it comes together, it feels better. Would definitely recommend for lovers of this genre.

This, however... was not it.<br/><br/>Where do I start? While I was expecting this to be a book set primarily in Hudson's lair, focused on Hudson and Grace's relationship, this is not that. Instead, you can tell that this is obviously Tracy Wolff trying to set up for the next book in the series. The fact that they're in the shadow realm and trying to run from the shadow queen would be <i>completely</i> random if you didn't know that was what's going to follow in the next book in the series. In fact, you know this was invented on the spot because in <i>Crush</i>, Hudson says that Grace was stuck in her Gargoyle form and did jumping jacks in his lair and would make the ground shake. This does not happen.<br/><br/>The focus is almost entirely on this strange shadow realm, and everything that's introduced feels more and more like a fever dream. Time dragons? Time wizard? Shadow realm? <i>Another</i> secret frozen gargoyle? Everything is fucking purple? At this point, Tracy's going to reveal that all humans are secretly gargoyles in disguise and they just didn't know it because the the oceans are actually mixed with memory loss concoctions because of all the hidden memory mermaids. That's how random this book felt.<br/><br/>As for the relationship between Hudson and Grace, it was just... wonky. Grace is absolutely terrible at communicating and she (more like Tracy) seems to invent problems on the spot just to have conflict. This leaves Hudson floundering every time Grace seems upset because he just has no idea why. He's also gone from this ""mysterious and suave bad boy with a heart of gold"" to... a completely different  dork. Which is fine, I guess, but it doesn't explain why he acts like this in this book (supposedly a prequel) and then suddenly changes back to how he previously behaved in <i>Crush</i>. It doesn't make sense that Hudson would just ignore everything about the shadow realm in <i>Crush</i>– it makes sense that he would be sad that Grace wouldn't remember all the years they spent together (which would be understandable if Tracy had gone with the previous route of ""oh, they were just in a mind-lair for several years""), but it's completely baffling that with all the trouble they were having in <i>Crush</i> he never mentions the shadow realm or queen once. Because this entire story didn't even exist before <i>Crush</i>. It's a nonsensical prequel.<br/><br/>Moreover, this book felt way too long (as do her other books). While I might've enjoyed the length if it were solely about a well developed story of Hudson and Grace's relationship (as I did with <i>Crush</i>), this just dragged with the weird and annoying plot about the shadow realm, shadow queen, and time wizard. At this point it's just Alice in Wonderland. And every time a character died (including that inane pet Smokey) I literally could barely care because I either didn't know the character well enough or because they were annoying and unnecessary (and I had no emotional attachment). <br/><br/>Overall, this book just made me tired. I was really looking forward to a slowburn enemies-to-lovers and trapped in one room story and instead we got... this bizarre mess. Really just kind of a let down. This book could've been a novella and I would've been 100 times happier with that than with what we got. 1.5 stars rounded down.",true,,1,0

I really enjoyed seeing the development of Jane as a young girl into a young woman capable of defending herself. Her struggles in the beginning were made more interesting by the fact that she overcomes them eventually. While I do feel icky about the age gap between Rochester and Jane, I'm willing to ignore/forgive that to focus on the writing (even though it was one of my biggest discomforts). I feel like the plot progressed very well in the beginning regarding her growing up, but lagged regarding <spoiler>her working for Rochester and when Jane left him</spoiler>. Still, the new characters and interactions between them and Jane were enough to not make me be fully irritated with it. <br/><br/>Another big annoyance was the style of the writing of this era, as always. While not too difficult to understand, reading all that description and sometimes unnecessary words was tiring, especially when you must read it within a limited amount of time. As for other issues, sometimes I just grew irritated with the characters and their contrivances for conflicts (i.e. miscommunication between Rochester and Jane). It's a typical trope, but not one I enjoy too much. I did, however, enjoy them getting back together again (even if it was weird for their ages).<br/><br/>Overall, the writing, slow plot (at times) and miscommunication irritated me, but the general story and fleshed-out characters made me enjoy the rest of it. 4 stars.

(I am a bigger fan of more descriptions, though, considering the characters felt both flat and three-dimensional at the same time due to the way the dialogue is written). Overall, three stars.

I’d give this 5 stars for my enjoyment, if not for the fact that I feel like this book took a long time for not enough to happen. I got to the end and I was like ""...is that it?"" I seriously thought there was going to be more because I felt like we had learned so little. Still, I've read books where the pacing was awful and I no longer wanted to read the book, but everything here made me consistently interested in what was going to happen next and how the world and characters were going to develop.

This is a command. This is an adjuration.</i><br/><br/>And this is a mostly very good book.<br/><br/>Have you ever felt bored while reading a book, but also felt like you couldn't pull away? That's how I felt reading this. I almost DNF'd at ~50%. While the worldbuilding is extremely interesting and the writing style just draws you in, I felt like only one or two things happened in the first ~60% of the book. I desperately wanted to know more about this world and the plot simply because I was barely being told anything about them throughout most of the book. I didn't know what the goal of the antagonist was until almost halfway through the book, and even then, it felt flimsy and ineffectual because it felt so shallow and unexplained. Even so, he was grandiose and interesting enough to make me not care as much about that (though it made me enjoy him less).<br/><br/>However, the writing throughout this book is absolutely brilliant, and really draws you in with the descriptions and the way the narrator speaks of the characters almost emotionally, rather than a typical book description. The characters were not my most favorite part of the book (but not bad), but their inclusion in the worldbuilding made me want to stay and understand them. The uniqueness of this world and the types of abilities the different characters had was just too intriguing for me to put the book down– and while that one thing was its saving grace, it was a large portion of the story.<br/><br/>Had the plot not sped up to an interesting pace at around 65-70%, this would've gotten a 4 star rating. However, having that last 30% fulfill everything else the book was building up to was worth it. But I do think this book could've been cut down by ~200 pages (828 pages total, ebook). All in all, 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.",,,1,0
